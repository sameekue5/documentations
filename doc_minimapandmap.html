            <p>

                This documentation lets you quickly get started with integrating this plugin to your projects and implement your own Minimap and Map in no time.



            </p>



            <div id="PluginStructure">

                <h5>The Plugin Structure</h5>

                <p>

                    Once you have installed the plugin from the launcher, either create a new project, or download the example project to test out. Ensure that the plugin is enabled by visiting the plugin window and browsing over to the IMapsAndNavigation plugin.

                </p>

                <img src="images/imaps/PluginWindow.png">

                <p>

                    The plugin comprises of various UserWidget classes, the example widgets demonstrating how to use them, and several actor classes which highlight the implementation of the system in a scene. It also contains the necessary materials and textures that we
                    would need for the demonstration. We now will look into how the contents of the plugin are defined and various functionalities of each class.

                </p>

                <p>

                    When you download the plugin from the Launcher, this is installed as an Engine plugin, so in order to view its contents you need to enable Show Engine Content from the View Options.

                </p>

                <img src="images/imaps/PluginStructure.png">

                <p>

                    In this section, we will learn a brief overview of various classes included in the plugin, and their functionalities.

                </p>

                <div id="MapBoundsActor">

                    <h6>The MapBounds Actor</h6>

                    <img src="images/imaps/MapBoundsActor.png">

                    <p>

                        Instances of MapBoundsActor class form the integral part of this plugin, as they define the Bound Area for both the Minimap and Map. Within the Blueprints folder, you will find a derived Blueprint chiild of the MapBoundsActor called BP_mapBoundsActor
                        which you can use to define the Map Bounds for your game. You need to place at least one of the instances in your scene. Each MapBoundsActor represents Bounds area corresponding to a given Minimap Texture. So having more than one
                        MapBoundsActor in a scene indicates switching between multiple Minimaps depending on position of the player. This is very useful for large or open world scenes, where you often need to switch your Minimap while moving inside a
                        different Bounds, like a cave, or a house interior.

                        Once we place our MapBoundsActors and define the bounds area and the other parameters, we are going to need an instance of MapManager Actor in our scene. This manages the entire system, displaying the minimap and the points of interest, transitioning
                        between the multiple BoundsActors, displaying the map and handling the input, displaying waypoints for destination markers. This comes with few tweakable parameters, and every level intending to use the Minimap system should contain
                        one MapManager.

                        <br />Widgets derived from the base class <strong>MinimapWidget</strong> can be used to design your customized Minimap. Minimaps are texture based and each MapBoundsActor corresponds to a Minimap Texture that would represent the
                        area within the respective Bounds. Minimaps can be rectangular as well as circular in nature with optional AutoRotate feature to automatically rotate the Minimap based on the Character rotation. Minimaps can have Zoom Levels ranging
                        between 0 and 1, with 1 being completely Zoomed Out. The Zoom Level can either be defined in the corresponding Material Instance applied on the Minimap, or via fixed Zoom Area, which will automatically calculate the Zoom Level
                        based on the predefined area, irrespective of the Bounds Size. Minimap Widgets calculate and display the position of the player and the Points of Interest in realtime.

                        To edit the Bounds size in either axis, you simple modify the corresponding <strong>Bounds Dimensions</strong> from the details panel respectively, instead of scaling the actor. Update the <strong>MinimapTexture</strong> property
                        to add your own texture that would represent the corresponding MapBoundsActor.

                            <li>The <strong>MinimapBorder</strong>, which encloses the entire widget and is used to calculate the Size of the Minimap.</li>

                            <li>The <strong>MinimapCanvas</strong>, which contains the Minimap Texture, the Points of Interest and the Player Position.</li>

                        The event <strong>OnMapInitialized</strong> is fired once, during the initialization of the Map. This event gives us the material instance corresponding to the entire map area of the current map, which we then set in the respective

                        To enable mouse interaction within Map, it is important to store the current mouse position in a variable. For that I am capturing the <strong>OnMouseMove</strong> event of our <strong>MapBorder</strong>, and setting the

                        To Zoom In and Out in the Map, we can call the function <strong>ZoomInOut</strong>. In the MapWidget example, I have bound the function with Mouse Wheel Axis. You can also use the functionality from the MapManager instance by calling
                        <strong>MapZoomInOut</strong>.

                    <p>

                        To set the navigation markers on button pressed at the given mouse location, we need to call the function <strong>SetMapNavigationOnClicked</strong> from the MapManager instance. For this function to work properly, the current

                        The events <strong>OnNavigationInBound</strong> and <strong>OnNavigationOutofBound</strong> are triggered when the destination is aligned with the player camera view, and when the destination is out of view, respectively. I am
                        using these events to display/hide custom pointer marker that shows direction of the navigation, as shown above.

                    <h6>Minimap Actor Component</h6>

                    <p>

                        So far we have seen that to add Points of Interest Elements in the Minimap and the Map, for actors belonging to specific classes, we simply add the class type in the POIElemet table, and specify the properties respective to the POI for that particular
                        Actor class type, and all actors in the current scene having the same class type will have same type of POI Element. But, sometimes, it is far convenient and useful to assign specific instances of a class a particular POI type,
                        or simply map some spefic actors in the level with some specific POI type. To do so, we need to attach <strong>Minimap Actor Component</strong> in the Actor that we want to assign a custom POI Element into.

                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Minimap Actor Component</strong> is a Blueprint derived from ActorComponent, and demonstrates how we can add custom POI Element for a specific actor in our MapManager.</p>

                    <p>

                        Just like how a normal ActorComponent works, you can attach the <strong>Minimap Actor Component</strong> to either your Blueprint Actor, or an actor already placed in the level, and then edit exposable structure variable <strong>POIElement</strong>                        to modify the properties for the corresponding POI Element of the given actor.

                        <strong>Minimap Actor Component</strong> is very useful for displaying other players in a <strong>Multiplayer</strong> game, when we attach the Component to our Player Pawn class. To hide the marker representing the player pawn,
                        as we already have a custom player marker added in our MinimapWidget, we can perform an additional condition check in our <strong>MinimapComponent</strong> class, found inside the Blueprints folder of our Plugin Content Directory.

                    <p>

                        As we have seen, the Bound shapes of the instances of MapBoundsActor class that we place in our level to define our Minimap Bounds, are rectangular. While this will solve purpose in most cases, when we do not explicitely switch between bounds in a single
                        level, there may be scenarios, when the limitation of the Bounds being rectangular will not prove useful when we are switching between multiple Bounds within the same level. For example, in an open world game, when we move inside
                        a cave, we might change the Minimap Bounds to show a different region, which is the interior of cave, and as soon as we come outside, we show the Minimap region representing the outside area. The cave is a non rectangular area,
                        and we must display smooth transition between the outside and the inside bounds. To achieve this, we use Minimap Mask Texture, in the instance of the MapBoundsActor the given non rectangular bounds is associated with. A Mask Texture
                        is a just an opacity texture of the actual Minimap Texture, where the black pixels represent the area which is outside the bounds of the current region. So, when the player is moved to the region corresponding to the black pixel
                        of the Minimap Mask Texture, the current location of the player will not be counted as being inside this non rectangualar bounds, and the outer Bounds area(which might represent world map, or a bigger region enclosing the current
                        region) will be considered as the current Bounds.

                    </p>

                    <p>Minimap Mask Texture can be added to the corresponding MapBoundsActor placed in the Scene.</p>

                    <p>

                        Circular Minimaps are created via Circular Opacity Masks applied to the material. To make your minimap circular in nature, which would not only changes the shape of the Minimap but will also ensure that the POI elements always stay within the circle,
                        you need to check the variable <strong>Allow Circle Mask</strong> in your Minimap Widget. You can also set your circular Minmiap to auto rotate with player rotation by checking the variable <strong>Auto Rotate Map</strong>.

                    <h6>Navigation Exit Actors</h6>

                    <p>

                        Navigation Exit Actors are the actors placed on scene which would be representing the exit point for the given navigation if the destination navigation is in different Bounds. For example if you are in a cave and you want to display the cave door as current
                        navigation , if the destination is outside the cave, then you can add the door as an exit actor. Multiple Navigation actors can be added against a given MapBoundsActor, to indicate that there are multiple points of exit, each of
                        which can be used to exit the immediate Bounds and navigate towards the destination.

                    </p>

                    <p>The array <strong>Navigation Exit Actors</strong>, in a given MapBoundsActor instance, contains references of dummy actors placed in the scene, which would display the location of local navigations when the player is inside the given
                        Bounds.

                    <p>Centrical Player Position has the Player marker position always located at the center of the Minimap. The Points of Interest elements, as well as the Minimap texture panning, are adjusted relative to the position of the player location
                        being at the center.</p>

                    <p>Acentric Player Position has the Player marker position calculated based on the current Bounds of the Minimap. So in this case, if the player moves towards the edges of the current MapBoundsActor, the player marker will accordingly
                        move towards the edges of the Minimap.</p>

                    <p>The class defauts variable <strong>Centrical Player Position</strong>, in the Minimap Widget, should be checked, to enable Centrical Player System.</p>

                    <p>

                        We have already learnt about how we use POIElement Datatable to add POI Elements corresponding to specific actors present in the scene. But by default, these POI ELements will already be created at the BeginPlay event, when the current scene is being
                        played. This will not be useful to add POI element in our Minimap, when a new POI Actor is dynamically spawned in the level. And if an enemy or any NPC representing specific POI in the Minimap, is killed, then we also need to remove
                        the corresponding POI Element for the actor who was just killed off. To handle these scenarios, we have couple of functions, for Adding new actor at runtime, or for removing an actor from the scene.

                    </p>

                    <p>The function <strong>Add Map Actor</strong> called from the current MapManager instance, after an AI is spawned, will add a POI element representing the type of the respective AI, as found from the POIElement Datatable.</p>
