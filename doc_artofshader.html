            <h1>Art of Shader Documentation</h1>
            <p>
                Although the Post Process Blendable Materials and their corresponding instances coming with every Art of Shader pack can be used in a Post Process Volume seperately placed in your level, there are Blueprint Actors specifically created to make several
                steps easy and more user friendly. This documentation is going to walk you through how to use the Blueprint Actors in your level and get the most out of the AOS Packs.
            </p>

            <div id="Introduction">
                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>
                    Before getting started implmeneting post processing in our environment, it is important to get ourselves acquainted with some of the basic concepts behind post processing as well as terminologies which form integral part in the AOS Series.
                </p>
                <div id="Blendables">
                    <h6>What are Blendables?</h6>
                    <p>
                        Blendables are Post Process materials that add custom Post Process Effect to your overall scene. Blendables are usually added in a Post Process Volume Actor, in the PostProcessMaterials array. Multiple Blendables can be added and given different weightage
                        between 0 and 1 to combine their effects accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More information on Blendables can be found in the below link :
                    </p>

                <div id="Localization">
                    <h6>Localization</h6>
                    <p>
                        Localization is a technique of adding Post Process Materials in the level, so that it affects only part of the level, and not the entire scene. For example, you have a CelShaded Material, and you do not want the entire scene to have the effect, when you
                        apply the same in your level, but rather a few objects, or a part of the screen. For this, you need to use Localization. In my shader packs, I have used two types of Localization, <strong>Object Space Localization</strong>,
                        using Custom Depth Stencil, and <strong>Screen Space Localization</strong>, using displaced UVs.

                    <h6>Types of Shaders</h6>
                    <p>
                        The Shaders can be differentiated into three types, based on the type of environment it affects.

                    Each Art of Shader Pack will come with a few Blueprint Actors, Widget Blueprints for Runtime Controls including a ColorPicker, few textures and a bunch of Post Process Blendable Materials, their corresponding Material Instances, and relevant Material
                    functions used by those Materials. The Common files like the Blueprints, the WidgetBlueprints, Assets for Demonstration, etc, will have the same folder names across all the AOS packs, making it easy to integrate and merge multiple
                    packs in same project. But the Blendable Materials and Instances specific to the given pack will have their own folder, like Stylized Post Process Materials will be present inside the folder called <strong>StylizedPostProcess</strong>.

                        <strong>BP_ArtOfShader</strong> is what you are going to need the most to develop the Post Process Effects for your own environment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To get started with, place an instance of <strong>BP_ArtOfShader</strong> in your level.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To populate your main environment, create an element in the <strong>MainShaders</strong> array in the instance of the <strong>BP_ArtOfShader</strong> you placed in your level. This element will represent a single group of Post Process Materials having common Localization and Blending properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       In the <strong>Materials</strong> array, create an array element, and assign a Post Process Material instance from the corresponding folder, i.e., if you have purchased the Stylized Post Process Pack, then the Material Instances will be found at <strong>StylizedPostProcesses/MaterialInstances</strong>.
                    </p>

                        Now you can see that the corresponding Post Process Material has been applied on your main environment. You can add more elements in the <strong>Materials</strong> array to combine multiple Blendables together, although not all of them will look equally good when combined with one another, so a lot of factors will come into play, and we will learn more about them as we progress.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        You can change the <strong>Blend</strong> value from 0 to 1, where 0 being no effect of the material(s) in the scene, while 1 means full effect. Blend happens through linear interpolation, and is different than the weight blended system present in the Post Process Volume Actor.

                    To populate your background environment, which mainly consists of the sky, create an element in the <strong>Background Shaders</strong> array in the instance of the <strong>BP_ArtOfShader</strong> you placed in your level. Just like
                    how added Materials and set the blend value in the MainShaders array, you can similarly do the same and see the effect occuring in your Sky and Atmosphere instead, keeping your Main Environment as it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, for some reason unknown to me, it is not possible to have Material Instances derived from the same Material to simultaneously affect both your Main and your Background environment. So, if that is what you desire, it is advisable to duplicate
                    the parent Material and create another instance out of it.

                    As you have already realized by now, you can easily combine and group and blend multiple Blendables to get the desired look of your environment.

            <h5>Working with Localization</h5>

            <p>
                Assuming you are able to get yourself familiar with the contents of the AOS Packs, we can now look into implementing Localization in our environment.
            </p>

            <div id="ObjectSpaceLocalization">
                <h6>Object Space Localization</h6>
                <p>
                    <strong>Object Space Localization (OSL)</strong> happens through Custom Depth Stencil. In this technique, it is possible to selectively apply Post Process Materials only to certain objects placed in the scene, and not the entire scene,
                    or to exclude certain objects from the effect of a given Post Process Materials that is applied to the rest of the scene.
                </p>
                <p>To use OSL, first you need to Enable Stencil Depth for your project. To do this, go to Edit -> Project Settings, search for Custom Depth, and then set <strong>Custom Depth-Stencil Pass</strong> to <strong>Enabled with Stencil</strong>.
                    Also ensure that the property <strong>Custom Depth with TemporalAA Jitter</strong> is checked.</p>

                <img src="images/artofshader/enablecustomdepthstencil.jpg">
                <p>
                    For the objects placed in the scene that need to get affected by the given Post process materials, set <strong>Render Custom Depth Pass</strong> to true, and for the property <strong>Custom Depth Stencil Value</strong>, set a value
                    between 0 and 255.
                </p>
                <img src="images/artofshader/enabledepthpass.jpg">
                <p>
                    When the Stencil values of the objects in the scene is set, those objects are now ready for Localization. To enable localization from your <strong>BP_ArtOfShader</strong> instance placed in the level, set the <strong>Localized</strong>                    property to true for one of the elements you created in either <strong>MainShaders</strong>, or <strong>CommonShaders</strong>. Also you need to set the StencilMinIndex and StencilMaxIndex appropriately, so that the Stencil values
                    of the objects being affected by the given Post Process effect falls between StencilMinIndex and StencilMaxIndex. For example, if you StencilMinIndex is 250 and StencilMaxIndex is 255, all the objects in the scene having custom depth
                    enabled and Stencil values between 250(inclusive) and 255(inclusive) will be affected when <strong>Localized</strong> is set to true, while the rest of the scene will be as it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reverse the effect of Object Space Localization, set <strong>ExcludeStencil</strong> parameter to true. This will disable the post process effect from the objects whose Stencil Values fall between StencilMinIndex and StencilMaxIndex,
                    while enabling the effect for the rest of the scene, depending on if the current change is made to <strong>MainShaders</strong>, or <strong>CommonShaders</strong>

                    <strong>Screen Space Localization(SSL)</strong> applies Post Process effect to only part of the screen, and not the entire screen. This is done by selectively choosing certain UVs and neglecting others via various conditional statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SSL can be divided into Simple SSL and Advanced SSL. Simple SSL can be activated directly from the <strong>BP_ArtOfShader</strong> instance placed in the level, from the <strong>SplitScreenParams</strong> structure variable that you
                    find at each element in the <strong>MainShaders</strong>, <strong>BackgroundShaders</strong> or <strong>CommonShaders</strong>.

                    Advanced SSL is a technique of splitting the screen via Polygonal Shape, which can be Rectangles, Circle, or an N-Side Polygon with some customization options to create some interesting shapes. Advanced SSL is not exposed to AOS Actor, but can be created
                    on top of the existing functionalities, by visiting the respective Material Instance Editor, and modifying the corresponding parameters.

                    When the <strong>PolygonSplit</strong> parameter is enabled, you will see the parameters respective to changing the shape , size and position of the polygon as required.
