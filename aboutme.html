                <h2>Difficult to imagine an alternate reality where I have not been a gamer, eh...</h2>

                <p>

                    Passionate towards video games, and a computer geek from heart for as long as I can remember, I was always interested in Mathematics and Physics during my school days, and Programming, mainly ever since I stepped out of college to join the field of Software
                    Engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But gaming, was everything for me. It was like breathing, or living. Completing difficult missions in Dragon Age, and solving challenging puzzles in Tomb Raider gave me joy and excitement comparable to how the youngest Seeker in a Quidditch team would
                    feel, after catching his/her very first Snitch.

                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi, I am Sameek Kundu, a Software Programmer and a Game Developer with expertise in Unreal Engine 4. I have been born and brought up in the city of joy, Kolkata.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a solo developer who currently develops game templates, plugins and asset packs for the Unreal Engine 4 Marketplace. My main interest is developing high end games, specially targeting PC, Playstation and VR devices, and currently I am working on
                    building my very first game, based on my own original story that I am writing in my free time.
                </p>

            <div id="Unreal">
                <h3>Unreal, a paradigm shift</h3>
                <p>
                    It was indeed, back when I was introduced to it in March, 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I was a gamer, it had never occurred to me about knowing the world of game development. As a child I always used to think that methods of game development are company's top secret which they do not reveal to the general masses, and the secret
                    of making a game will not be known to an enthusiastic person unless he/she joins the gaming industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My misconception was partly cleared when I was showing interest and getting my hands dirty with several 3D Modelling and Animation Tools, and back in 2012-2013, when I came across with Cryengine and UDK, which was completely free for everyone, imagine
                    the excitement I started to have. I was blown away by the beautiful graphics of Cryenigne ,whether it is the volumetric Clouds, or the amazing water shader, or the foliage and the world building tools that was letting me create level
                    comparable to the graphics of games like Farcry, within minutes. Although Cryengine was amazing in getting started with outdoor environment building, I found UDK to be much easier and simpler, but not as good in terms of graphics.
                    The comicky outlook irrespective the type of environment I wanted to create was always bothering me. These all were before Unreal Engine 4 was launched, in March, 2014. Ever since then, there was no reason to look back.
