            <h1>Runtime FBX Import Documentation</h1>
            <p>
                This documentation covers details of how to integrate this plugin in your own project. By the end of this documentation you should be able to have a better understanding of importing custom FBX meshes from hard drive during gameplay in your unreal project,
                and triggering notifications or perform other tasks while the import is in progress, as the process is asynchronous. You will also have a clear understanding of updating material properties for individual sections.
            </p>

            <div id="ClassDescription">
                <h5>Class Description</h5>
                <p>
                    Before we get started, We will be looking into two main classes that drive the entire Import process.
                </p>

                <div id="fbximportManager">
                    <h6>The FBX Import Manager</h6>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>fbximportManager</strong> Actor class is responsible for handling the import of FBX files and generatation of Procedural Mesh Components from the imported FBX scenes. A child Blueprint derived from the <strong>fbximportManager</strong>,
                        found in the Blueprints folder of the plugin Content directory, has been created as an example and can be used to quickly start implementing this plugin in your projects. You must place an instance of the <strong>fbximportManager</strong>                        in your level, before you can begin importing your files.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div id="FBXMeshActor">

                    <h6>The FBX Mesh Actor</h6>
                    <p>
                        Every FBX file requested for import within the <strong>fbximportManager</strong>, corresponds to a spawned instance of <strong>FBXMeshActor</strong> class. We can use reference to this class to manipulate actor specific modifications
                        like setting transform and updating materials.

                    </p>

                </div>

            <div id="GettingStarted">

                <h5>Getting Started</h5>

                <p>

                    Once you have installed the plugin from the launcher, ensure that the plugin is enabled by visiting the plugin window and browsing over to the Runtimefbximport plugin.

                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have not downloaded the example project yet, you can <a href="https://athiangames.com/projectfiles/fbximportexamples.zip">download it here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Once you have opened the project and enabled the plugin, you can hit play to quickly test out the functionalities. Using left mouse button you can specify where you want to spawn the FBX, and then click on the import button, and select
                    your file to begin the asynchronous import process.
                </p>
                <img src="images/assetimport/importfbxtest.jpg">
                <p>Once the Import is completed you can select individual components of your imported Actor with Left mouse click and change properties, like set Textures, Color, or entire material. You can also hide/unhide or isolate individual sections
                    of selected actor, if required.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        The Plugin Content directory contains example blueprints and widgets which is very useful as a starting point to understand the functinalities of the plugin as well as to test out the core features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To view the Plugin Content directory, you need to click on the eye icon at the bottom right of the Content Browser, and enable <strong>Show Engine Content</strong>.

                    <p>
                        Inside the Blueprints folder, you will find <strong>BP_fbximportManager</strong>, which is derived from the <strong>fbximportManager</strong> class, and <strong>BP_FBXMeshActor</strong>, derived from <strong>FBXMeshActor</strong>                        class.

                        The character BP, <strong>BP_FlyCamCharacter</strong> , which you can find on navigating inside the Blueprints folder of the project directory, is responsible for using the fbximportFunction to import FBX, and also determining
                        which components to select using Line Trace. Obviously this is just for demonstration and you can have your own representation of how you want to import your FBX mesh.

                <h5>Importing FBX Files</h5>

                <p>

                    The import process is a multi threaded or asynchronous operation. The FBX scene from the given file path is read as groups of Nodes, each node consisting of FBX mesh with several unique material sections. Each such section is generated as a Procedural
                    Mesh Component that is then displayed in the Unreal Scene. Each section is a child of a particular node, as read from the original source file. So each Procedural Mesh Component has a NodeID as well as a SectionID.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Since the process can take a while to fully load the entire FBX scene, depending on the complexity of the given FBX scene, we have custom events that get triggered during the import, and can be used to display custom notifications, or perform other tasks
                    relevant to the Node being imported currently.

                </p>



                <div id="TheImportFunction">

                    <h6>The Import Function</h6>

                    <p>

                        The function ImportFBXFile begins the asynchronous operation of a single FBX file, with the full filepath and the world location for the import, as input parameters. This function resides inside the fbximportManager class.

                        When the function ImportFBXFile is called, we specify string FileName, which contains the fullpath, like "D:\Projects\FBX\Girl01.fbx". This can be constructed from the list of Blueprint exposed Path functions relative to the Project Directory, as shown
                        below.

                    <p>

                        An FBX mesh usually contains materials applied to them, divided into material sections with unique section indices. Each material section comprises of Materials developed in external 3d application, but contains common data like diffuse, opacity, normal,
                        emissive and specular textures, diffuse color, etc. When an FBX mesh is imported, it also reads and imports the color and texture values from the corresponding source file. This values are set and applied in parameterized materials
                        that we can add in our Procedural Mesh Component which are generated from the unique material sections of a given FBX mesh. So when we are calling the function ImportFBXFile, we can specify a default parameterized material that
                        are going to auto apply in the generated mesh sections, with the textures and color values set, depending on the parameterization of the input material. We also have the option to update a particular mesh section with a specific
                        material.

                        When the FBX file is being imported via the ImportFBXFile function, it can be chosen to either have no collisions, or collisions read from the source file, via the CollisionType input parameter.

                    <p>

                        To create optimized collisions for your Procedural Mesh Components generated from the FBX Meshes, it is important to have simplified collision geometries. Of course we can have collisions derived from the imported Meshes itself, but for high poly meshes,
                        it is going to be extremely performance heavy and not a recommended way to create collisions. So creating custom collision geometries within your 3d Modelling applications and exporting it with the render mesh is required for this
                        plugin to create collision data for the generated Procedural Mesh Components.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Collision meshes are identified by this plugin based on their names. The collision naming syntax should be UCX_[RenderMeshName].

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        While importing, if you choose to have collision type as MeshCollisionFromSource, it means the geometries matching the naming pattern UCX_[RenderMeshName] will be imported as both render mesh and collision data. But choosing the collision type as CustomCollisionFromSource
                        would rather implies that the geometries matching the naming pattern UCX_[RenderMeshName] will be imported as collision data only, and will not be rendered seperately.

                    <p>

                        Once the import process of a given FBX file is started, few events notifying the Import Manager of the import progress get triggered. These events need to be defined in the Import Manager Blueprint, and can be used to display custom notifications on screen,
                        or perform other tasks, for example, displaying a dynamic Loading screen which disappears after all the FBX meshes are completely imported and corresponding mesh components have been generated in the current level.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        The event <strong>On New FBX Import Started</strong> is fired when a new FBX Import process has started.

                        The event <strong>On FBX Node Progress Changed</strong> is fired when a new FBX Node has been Imported, with each individual sections of the Node has been generated into Procedural Mesh Components.

                        The event <strong>On FBX Section Progress Changed</strong> is fired when a new FBX Section is imported and generated into a Procedural Mesh Component.

                        The event <strong>On Import Completed</strong> is fired when athe current FBX Import process is completed. This returns an actor of the type FBXMeshActor, which can be stored in a variable for later use.

                <h5>Using Parameterized Materials</h5>

                <p>

                    To read the textures from the imported FBX file and apply at respective sections of the Procedural Mesh Component, it is important to create parameterized materials, following a specific naming convention for the paramters, so that while the respective
                    FBX section is converted into a Procedural Mesh Component, a dynamic material is created and corresponding textures can be set in the property values that match the given naming convention.

                </p>



                <p>

                    The example Base Material can be found inside content directory of the <strong>Runtimefbximport</strong> Plugin and it can act as a parent material for the instances created during each section of the imported mesh.

                <p>

                    Once the FBX Actor is imported and placed in your level, you might want to save the Actor, so that next time you want to load the scene, you dont have to go through the import process all over again for the same actor, and you can just load the actor
                    from your savegame file.

                </p>

                <div id="SavingFBXActor">
                    <h6>Saving FBX Actor</h6>
                    <p>
                        To save a given FBX Actor, you can get its reference and call the function <strong>FBXSaveGame</strong>, and pass the filename along with extension, that you want to save your FBX in.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/assetimport/savefbxactor.jpg">

                <div id="LoadingFBXActor">

                    <h6>Loading FBX Actor</h6>
                    <p>
                        To load a saved FBX Actor, you first need to get instances of your SaveGame Object, that would be recreating from the saved files you had create before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SaveGame Object instances can be obtained by calling the function <strong>GetAllFBXSavedFiles</strong>. This takes the directory path to look for the FBX files saved previously, and return all instances retrieved inside given directory,
                        filtered by extension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we have out SaveGame Instances, we need to get the instance of our <strong>fbximportManager</strong> Actor class placed in the level, call the function <strong>LoadFBXfromSaveGameObject</strong> , where we pass the SaveGame
                        Object instance for our saved FBX object, which we want to load currently.
